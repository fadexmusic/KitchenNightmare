You shouldn't keep them long there though! The food isn't fresh for long, and it rots after a while, and you have to throw it out.
Luckily, the food rots slower in the fridge, where you should keep it and cook a meal from it as soon as posibble. If your food gets rotten,
you'll have to throw it out sometime, but don't leave it long - all the ingredients to the right and left of the rotten food start rotting faster.

Now, you have two types of shifts to chose. 
In the timed one, your goal is to earn as much money as possible till your shift ends.
In the infinite one, you are trying to last as long as possible.


All that said, good luck and fun in the kitchen, and don't screw it up!"
